# PowerShell-Profile
My PowerShell configuration for an efficient CLI. Compatible with any operating system.

## Installation
### Required programs
- [PowerShell](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell)
- [Zoxide](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide) for file navigation with the `z` command

### Clone the profile
- open the previously installed PowerShell
- `mkdir $PROFILE/..`: create the folder that will contain this PowerShell profile
- `cd $PROFILE/..`: move to the folder you just created  
- `git clone https://github.com/Bluzzi/PowerShell-Profile.git .`: clone this repo in the current directory
- reload your PowerShell

Everything should work! ðŸŽ‰
