# PowerShell-Profile
My PowerShell configuration for an efficient CLI. Compatible with any operating system.

## Installation
### Required programs
- [PowerShell](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell)
- [Zoxide](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide) for file navigation with the `z` command

### Clone the profile
Open the previously installed PowerShell.

Create the folder that will contain this PowerShell profile via the `mkdir $PROFILE/..` command.

Move to the folder you just created with the `cd $PROFILE/..` command. 

Clone this repo in the current directory with the `git clone https://github.com/Bluzzi/PowerShell-Profile.git .` command, this may not work if the `$PROFILE` folder already contains files.
